# Deep Learning With Pytorch

This is my attempy at following along with Daniel Bourke's Deep Learning with PyTorch Course, through this series I aim to develop a foundational understanding of deep learning, 
neural networks, computer vision, applied machine learning, in PyTorch. 

The notebooks created within this repo result from trailing along with Daniel's series for the purpose of learning, and are fundementally _**not**_ my own creation.
